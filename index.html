Ajo ka qenë një pikë kyçe për zhvillimin e industrisë së filmit dhe televizionit në vend. Pas ndryshimeve politike, Kinostudioja humbi funksionin e saj dhe sot është një hapësirë që përdoret për aktivitete kulturore dhe kreative. Ajo është një simbol i trashëgimisë kulturore të filmit shqiptar dhe ka qenë një vend ku janë xhiruar disa prej filmave më të njohur të Shqipërisë.
